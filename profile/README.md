# Paradigm Open Source

[Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/) is an investment firm focused on supporting the crypto/Web3 companies and protocols of tomorrow. Our approach is flexible, long term, multi-stage, and global.
We often get involved at the earliest stages of formation and continue supporting our portfolio companies over time.

We take a deeply hands-on approach to help projects reach their full potential, from the technical (mechanism design, smart contract security, engineering) 
to the operational (recruiting, regulatory strategy).

This Github Organization hosts all of Paradigm's open source experiments, designs, and production-ready code.

Other projects we support:
* [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/): A blazing-fast hookable Rust EVM by [Dragan Rakita](https://github.com/rakita)
* [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) ([Announcement[(https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/11/paradigm-and-wagmi)): A Javascript library for web3 frontends, which provides simple hooks (e.g. useBalance) for developers to interact with Ethereum, by [Tom Meagher](https://github.com/tmm/) and [Jake Moxey](https://github.com/jxom)
